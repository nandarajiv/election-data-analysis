#### Title: Framing and Agenda-setting in Russian News: a Computational Analysis of Intricate Political Strategies

The paper looks into how the Russian government uses the media to influence public opinion through techniques of framing and agenda-setting. The authors employ computational methodology to study Russian newspaper <i>Izvestia</i> over a period of thirteen years, which despite a brief period of autonomy, has become strongly influenced by the government. They postulate that the more direct methods such as censorship and "fake news" which are easier to identify, have gained a great deal of attention in the contexts of Russia and China, but authoritarian governments also use more subtle techniques of framing and agenda-setting, which are also powerful tools to influence public perception.

<b>Methods used for Analysing Agenda-Setting:</b>
- Correlations: The authors' hypothesis that news focused on US coverage is used to distract the public from negative economic events, and use correlations to find that it is in fact a clear negative correlation between the Russian GDP and % of Articles on USA in the paper.
- Granger Causaility: Effects based on the key concept that cause precedes effect in time. This was able to establish that a decline in the stock market usually precedes (by about one month) an uptick of articles focused on the USA.

<b>Methods used for Analysing Framing:</b>
- Generating framing lexicons: The method seeks to create a lexicon of English words by estimating their occurrence and discarding ones that occur in fewer than 0.5% of the documents. 
- Translation and Extension: The paper speaks about the use of Google Translate to translate the lexicons into English (this is discussed later as a concern) and create a final lexicon by using clusering methods.

A few concerns regarding the paper are that firstly, they mention that while such research has been done in other languages, work on Russian media has been limited, due to challenges of translations. However it mentioned that the authors have used Google Translate from Russian to English, which is widely known to be a poor tool. Secondly, it is a concern that the authors are studying only one single paper, and generalising it to Framing and Agenda-Setting in Russian News. Third, there is little discussion on what the actual ground impact of these strategies are, and there is not sufficient emphasis on what the effective results of these stretegies are.

This kind of study could be potentially very useful in India, in the upcoming 2024 elections, and could be leveraged for social media as well. 

One important point to emphasise when adopting the methodologies of this paper into the Indian context is translation, and that would be a challenge considering the wide range of media coverage. Gaining understanding of what framing and agenda-setting techniques are empoyed and hence the kind of media coverage on certain topics, could be specifically relevant to the Indian context, as it is a good determiner of imcumbency.

<b> Project Ideas for 2024 Elections:</b>
- One of the important factors emerging that could affect the upcoming election is the dual effect of an uptick in regionalism tied, which is being tapped into by new national coalitions. Getting an understanding of the effects of these, and how regional parties could sway states for or against the incumbent government could be an interesting exercise to predict outcomes of this election.
- Studying turnout in urban and rural areas for general elections is also an important question. Recently, at the Karnataka elections, a matter of discussion was the low turnout in urban areas, and how it could point to diminishing feelings of representation and influence of a citizen's vote. As has been used in one of the analyses, turnout is an important measure of public perception of representation and democracy, and studying it for this general election could be of value.
